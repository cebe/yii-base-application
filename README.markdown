Base Applicaton for [Yii](http://www.yiiframework.com/ "Yii Framework")-Applications
====================================================================================

This is a base application to start a new project on.

I started developing just now, so it's not yet ready to use.

It aims to be a bit more prepared than the application created by yiic webapp.

Installation
------------

* fork/clone this repository.
* Download latest [yii-framework](http://yii.googlecode.com/files/yii-1.1.6.r2877.tar.gz "Yii-1.1.6") and extract it to the base directory.
* make link `yii` point to <your extracted yii>/framework
